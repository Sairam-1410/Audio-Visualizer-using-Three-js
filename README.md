# Audio-Visualizer-using-Three-js
This project implements an interactive audio visualizer using Three.js, which dynamically visualizes sound frequencies and audio data. The audio input is processed through an AudioContext, with visualizations responding to audio frequencies in real-time. The visual elements include interactive 3D shapes .
